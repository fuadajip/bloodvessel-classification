## Description

Human eye is one of the most important human part to see the object. Eye have many suborgan with their own function. Especially is blood vessels. Eye contain blood vessels to deliver oxygen or carbondioxyde to the eye. Many information we can get with analyze blood vessels from fundus image. The blood vessels in the eye classified into two there are artery and veins. Artery is blood vessels that transport blood with rich oxygen to the eye. Veins is blood vessels to transport blood contain carbon dioxyde get out from the eye to heart.

We can't manually classification the blood vessels segment in the eye. We must use fundus image to process the segmentation to classification the artery and veins in blood vessels of fundus image. Artery and veins have their criteria make each other is different. To achieve the goals of classification artery and veins in fundus image, i use the matlab software for the image processing. This program created to mid-task in University.
